In this project I'm building an entire e-commerce with a lot of different functionalities 

So in this project the user will be able to buy the products he wants, filter per category, the website indicates other types of products accordingly to those he visit or buy
and so on...

Also, in case the user is a superuser, in other words, registered by the django-admin page, he will be able to register a new product and make CRUD operations if this be necessary 

In case the user wants to talk with the seller, in this application I develop a chat application for that too, where the user will not just chat with the seller but also have
all the conversation registered in case he needs it in the future

For this application I've used HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript in the front-end and Python, Django, Django REST, PostgreSQL and AWS (EC2, RDS and S3) in the backend

The index.html of the website looks like that:

In this case I'm with a superuser and I'm able to add new products like bellow:

Now I'm logged in with a normal user and now, accesing a normal product we can see that we have the chat application
